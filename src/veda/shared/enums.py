File: src/veda/shared/enums.py
Title: Canonical Enumerations
Layer: Shared data contract
Status: Merged prototype foundation

Purpose
-------
Defines the single controlled vocabulary used by the merged VEDA system.

The personal prototype used inline Literal values such as "supported",
"insufficient", "answerable", and "insufficient_evidence". The original
VEDA prototype used standalone enums for entity resolution, evidence
categories, claim status, assessment status, missing evidence, and
comparison results.

This merged module reconciles those values so that models, providers,
normalizers, pipeline stages, interfaces, future provenance code, and
future benchmark code all use the same vocabulary.

No other module in src/veda/ may define duplicate enums.

Responsibilities
----------------
- Define source types.
- Define entity and relationship-related types.
- Define entity-resolution outcomes.
- Define evidence categories.
- Define extraction methods.
- Define confidence levels.
- Define claim statuses.
- Define assessment statuses.
- Define missing-evidence reasons.
- Define comparison outcomes.
- Define reporting-period matching states.
- Define provider result states.

This file does not:
-------------------
- Make network requests.
- Resolve entities.
- Normalize source records.
- Extract claims.
- Detect conflicts.
- Build assessment packets.
- Build the provenance graph.
- Run the benchmark.

Migration notes
---------------
- The personal prototype's "deterministic_json" extraction method is
  preserved as ExtractionMethod.DETERMINISTIC_JSON.
- The personal prototype's "answerable" packet status is migrated to
  AssessmentStatus.SUPPORTED. The old string is not silently accepted as
  a new canonical output value.
- The original VEDA prototype's "insufficient" idea is represented by
  ClaimStatus.INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE.
- Claims and assessments deliberately use different status enums because
  a supported claim can exist inside an assessment that requires review
  due to another claim or conflict.

Serialization
-------------
Every enum subclasses str and Enum so Pydantic serializes its members as
plain JSON strings.
