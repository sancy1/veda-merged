Title: Normalized Reporting Periods
Layer: Shared data contract
Status: Merged prototype foundation

Purpose
-------
Defines the canonical representation of a reporting period and the
rules that compare one period against another.

Every claim, every piece of evidence, and every assessment in the
merged VEDA system refers to a period through this module. No other
module constructs its own period representation, and no other module
compares dates directly to decide whether evidence matches a request.

The rules encoded here come from the personal prototype's
prototype/extractor.py, which discovered during live SEC testing that
SEC's own "fy" and "fp" labels cannot be trusted. The fiscal year of a
value must be derived from the actual end date of the reported period,
and a full-year span must be distinguished from a quarterly or
partial-year span by measuring the number of days between the actual
start and end dates.

The structural shape of a period with valid_from/valid_to dates comes
from the original VEDA prototype's TemporalValidity model in
app/models.py.

Responsibilities
----------------
- Define the RequestedPeriod object: what the caller asked for.
- Define the Period object: what a specific piece of evidence covers.
- Encode the full-year span rule via MIN_ANNUAL_PERIOD_DAYS and
  MAX_ANNUAL_PERIOD_DAYS.
- Provide a Period.days() method that computes the actual span.
- Provide a Period.is_full_year() method that applies the span rule.
- Provide a Period.match_status_against() method that returns a
  PeriodMatchStatus describing how two periods relate.
- Provide construction helpers for building a Period from raw SEC
  XBRL start/end strings.

This file does not:
-------------------
- Make network requests.
- Parse source documents.
- Extract claims.
- Normalize evidence records.
- Decide whether an assessment should abstain.

Design notes
------------
- A RequestedPeriod is what the user typed. It may be incomplete (only
  a fiscal year) or precise (a start and end date). A Period is what a
  specific record actually covers. The two are different concepts and
  are represented by different classes.
- A Period may have unknown dates. When it does, days() and
  is_full_year() return None, and match_status_against() returns
  PeriodMatchStatus.UNKNOWN. The system never guesses a period.
- The 350-380 day window for a full-year span accounts for leap years
  and for the 52/53-week fiscal calendars used by some filers. A
  53-week year is 371 days; a 52-week year is 364 days. Both are
  inside the window. A quarter is 90-92 days and is outside.

        1. If the requested period supplies start and/or end dates,
           and this period supplies the corresponding dates, compare
           the dates directly. If they match on every supplied field,
           return EXACT. If they differ on any supplied field, return
           MISMATCH. This is what makes a 90-day quarter ending
           2024-03-31 differ from a full year ending 2024-12-31 for a
           request that supplied explicit dates.

        2. Fall through to fiscal-year comparison. If this period has
           no end date, return UNKNOWN. If the fiscal years match,
           return EXACT. If they differ by exactly one year, return
           ADJACENT. Otherwise return MISMATCH.

        This preserves the original fiscal-year-only behavior for
        callers who supplied only a fiscal year, while adding
        exact-date comparison for callers who supplied dates.

        covering only a quarter cannot satisfy a full-year request -
        is enforced at stage 1 whenever the request supplies a date
        range. When the request supplies only a year, stage 2 is the
        best available comparison and the pipeline relies on the
        extraction layer to have already excluded quarterly records
