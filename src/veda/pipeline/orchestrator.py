Title: Pipeline Orchestrator
Layer: Pipeline layer
Status: Merged prototype foundation — Phase 6

Purpose
-------
Wires the Phase 6 stages into one ordered pipeline function that
turns a vendor name and a requested period into a validated
Assessment packet. This is the pipeline's only entry point.

Public API
----------
ProviderBundle
run_assessment(vendor_name, requested_period, bundle,
               resolver_source, user_agent) -> Assessment

Does not
--------
Does not make network calls.
Does not import veda.providers.fixtures.
Does not hardcode fixture values.
Does not mutate inputs.
Does not bypass validate_assessment.

Design notes
------------
Sequence, frozen:

    entity_resolver.resolve
      -> provider.retrieve (four providers)
      -> normalizers (Phase 5)
      -> backfill undated evidence periods
      -> extract_claims
      -> detect_conflicts
      -> compute_missing_evidence
      -> build_assessment_status
      -> build_packet
      -> validate_assessment

ProviderBundle carries the four provider instances plus optional SEC
filing metadata. FixtureSECFilingsProvider requires cik,
accession_number, filing_form, and field_or_passage_hint to return
a passage. The orchestrator passes the three bundle fields through
unchanged.

Period backfill
---------------
Phase 5 non-SEC normalizers produce label-only periods. The frozen
assessment validation requires every evidence and claim period to
match the assessment period exactly. A label-only period compared
against a dated request returns UNKNOWN.

The orchestrator backfills undated evidence periods from the
requested period before claim extraction. That preserves consistent
Evidence, Claim, and Assessment periods and produces claim IDs from
the final fiscal-year period.
